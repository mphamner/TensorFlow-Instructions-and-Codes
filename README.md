# TensorFlow
Updated January 2022!!!

This repository now includes instructions for using TensorFlow through R!  Keep in mind that version compatibility 
has been and continues to be a "HUGE" issue!  


This is a repository for TensorFlow instructions and codes.  Note that the codes are contained in Jupyter notebooks.

You will find two instrucional files; one for installing TensorFlow on Windows or Mac machines, another for using 
TensorFlow on Windows or Mach machines.
